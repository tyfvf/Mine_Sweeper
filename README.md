# Mine Sweeper

A simple mine sweeper game, just to practice some logic, ~~prehaps i add some more features in the future, like a difficulty option~~ (already added).
The basics of mine sweeper is here the flags, the numbers, a happy face if you win and a sad face if you don't, if you wish to restart just press the face

## A little showcase:
